# 🔢 Bitwise Operations and Number Theory in C++

This repository contains a curated set of C++ programs demonstrating fundamental and advanced concepts in **bitwise operations**, **binary arithmetic**, and **number theory** — all implemented from scratch with efficient logic and no shortcuts.

These are ideal for:
- Interview preparation
- Low-level C++ practice
- Understanding binary manipulation and prime algorithms

## 📁 List of Programs

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `bitwise_operations.cpp` | Demonstrates bitwise AND, OR, XOR, NOT, left shift, and right shift with binary output. |
| `binary_to_decimal.cpp` | Two versions: convert binary (as int and as string) to decimal. |
| `decimal_to_binary.cpp` | Two versions: convert decimal to binary (as string and as integer). |
| `odd_even_check.cpp` | Checks whether a number is odd or even using bitwise AND. |
| `bit_check.cpp` | Checks whether the i-th bit is set in a number using bitmasking. |
| `ones_twos_complement.cpp` | Calculates 1’s and 2’s complement of a binary number represented as a string. |
| `power_function.cpp` | Computes `x^n` using fast exponentiation and bitwise logic, supporting negative exponents. |
| `prime_factors.cpp` | Efficient prime factorization using bitwise division and loop-based reduction. |
| `count_set_bits.cpp` | Counts the number of 1’s in the binary representation of a number. |
| `count_primes_range.cpp` | Uses Sieve of Eratosthenes to count prime numbers in a given range `[L, R)`. |
| `sieve_of_eratosthenes.cpp` | Prints all prime numbers up to `n` using the classic Sieve algorithm. |
| `bitwise_sum.cpp` | Adds two integers without using the `+` operator (uses bitwise XOR and AND). |
| `xor_swap.cpp` | Swaps two variables using XOR without a temporary variable. |
